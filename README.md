## iOS PictureInPicture Sample
This example demonstrates the implementation of Picture-in-Picture (PIP) mode in a calling application that uses WebRTC for VoIP functionality. The sample showcases how a video call continues seamlessly when the app switches to PIP mode. In the PIP window, the app provides action buttons to pause or resume the video stream, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### The PiP (Picture-in-Picture) window offers versatile controls:

- Drag to reposition.
- Single-tap for options like full-screen toggle.
- Double-tap to switch between minimized and maximized sizes.
- Stash the window by dragging it to the screen's edge, and unstash by tapping or dragging it out.
